# RL-project
Source code of the Digital Logic Design project course at PoliMi.

## Target
VHDL implementation of a image scanning program.

## Built With
* [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) - The IDE used

## Result
The aim of the project is to, given an image (rappresented with a matrix in which every cell contains a binary number), calculate the smallest rectangle's area that contains every cell that has a number bigger than a given threshold. 
The program provides an output with the 16 bit binary area.
